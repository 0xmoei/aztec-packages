# The Aztec Testnet is live! ðŸ¥³

With a growing network of over 100 active nodes, Aztec is the first fully decentralized L2 testnet that prioritizes privacy from day one. Aztec implements a unique VM designed for privacy-preserving transactions. It has both public and private states, enabling seamless composability across these domains.
